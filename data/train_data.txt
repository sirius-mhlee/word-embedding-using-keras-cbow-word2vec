Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay.
Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.
Users can contribute anonymously, under a pseudonym, or, if they choose to, with their real identity.
The fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the five pillars.
The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve the encyclopedia, however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing.
Wikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways.
Unlike printed encyclopedias, Wikipedia is continually created and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years.
Because everybody can help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia.
In addition to quantity, its contributors work on improving quality as well.
Wikipedia is a work-in-progress, with articles in various stages of completion.
